# Job-Scheduler
This is a program to schedule jobs into a schedule. There are 4 options in the program; 
view the schedule, add a job, delete a job, and exit the program. The program upon running
will make a schedule with pre-loaded jobs from the data.txt file. Jobs can be scheduled or
removed through the program, without changing the order of existing jobs. Only one job can run at a 
time, the program will reject additions of jobs that overlap existing jobs. The data.txt file is 
dynamically updated as jobs are added or removed, and are saved in data.txt when the user exits the program.
